# The ALX Project - ES6 Promises
------------

This project __ES6 Promises__, is part of the curriculum at __ALX__ and  it focuses on
the concept and usage of `Promises` in __JavaScript__, specifically as implemented in __ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)__.
Promises are a fundamental aspect of asynchronous programming in JavaScript,
providing a way to work with asynchronous operations more effectively and handle their outcomes in a structured manner.

In this project, the goal is to create and work with `Promises`, understand their __syntax and methods__,
and leverage them to manage asynchronous code execution and handle success or failure outcomes gracefully.


## Project Objectives :briefcase: :package:

- Understand the purpose and benefits of using `Promises` in JavaScript.
- Create `Promises` using the `Promise` constructor.
- Use the `then` and `catch` methods to handle `Promise` outcomes.
- Implement error handling and propagation with `Promises`.
- Chain multiple `Promises` together to create sequences of asynchronous operations.
- Utilize the `Promise.all()` method to handle multiple `Promises` simultaneously.
- Grasp the basics of asynchronous code execution and flow control.


## Project Requirements :toolbox:

To complete the tasks in this project, the following are important:

- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing `JavaScript` code.
- A `JavaScript` runtime environment (such as __Node.js__) to execute your `JavaScript` programs.


## Project Tasks :open_file_folder: :heavy_check_mark:

This project consists of a series of tasks, each focused on a specific aspect of __Promises__ in `JavaScript`.

Here is an overview of the project tasks:

|------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0          | Promise me a vow                        | Introduction to creating and using Promises. You'll create a Promise and use the resolve and reject methods.                          |
| 1          | Some promise                            | Implementing a simple function that returns a resolved Promise with a given value.                |
| 2          | Reject me not                           | Creating a function that returns a rejected Promise with a custom error message.                  |
| 3          | Handle multiple successful Promises      | Demonstrating how to use Promise.all() to handle multiple Promises and collect their results.     |
| 4          | Simple promise                          | Creating a function that returns a resolved Promise with a delayed value.                           |
| 5          | Reject the promises                      | Implementing a function that returns a rejected Promise with a specified delay.                     |
| 6          | Handle multiple Promises                 | Creating a function that takes an array of Promises and returns a Promise that resolves with an array of resolved values or rejects with the first encountered error. |
| 7          | Load balancer                           | Creating a simple load balancer using Promises to simulate asynchronous task execution.          |
| 8          | Throw error / try catch                 | Practicing error handling with Promises using try...catch blocks.      |
| 9          | Throw an error                          | Creating a function that throws an error with a specific message.     |
