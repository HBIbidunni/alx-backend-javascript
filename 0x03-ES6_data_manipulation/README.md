# The ALX Project: ES6 data manipulation
------------

This project focuses on __mastering ES6__ (`ECMAScript 2015`) features for data manipulation. 
__ES6__ introduces powerful and concise syntax for handling `arrays`, `objects`, and `promises`, 
allowing for efficient and readable code. 

In this project, various aspects of __ES6__ are analysed, enabling efficient data manipulation and transformation.
