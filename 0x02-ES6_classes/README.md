# ES6 classes - The ALX Project
----------

This project focuses on understanding and implementing __ES6 classes__ in `JavaScript`. 
__ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)__ introduced a new way to work with __object-oriented programming__ 
in `JavaScript`, making it more efficient and developer-friendly.

The goal of this project is to explain how to define and use __ES6 classes__,
and the key concepts related to __object-oriented programming__ in __JavaScript__. 
A set of __class-based__ exercises would be implemented to solidify the understanding of __ES6 classes__.
